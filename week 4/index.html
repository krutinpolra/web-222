                <h2>Themes and Social Commentary</h2>
                <p>
                    At its core, "3 Idiots" is a satirical critique of the rigid and oppressive education system in India. The film unearths the stress, competition, and immense expectations<br>
                    that students face. It presents a powerful argument for a more creative and flexible approach to education, emphasizing that true learning stems from curiosity, innovation, <br>
                    and genuine interest rather than rote memorization.
                </p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <strong>"Don't run behind success, chase excellence and success will come chasing you."<em> <a href="#rancho">-rancho (movie character)</a></em></strong> 
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    The pursuit of passion is a recurring theme in the movie. It encourages viewers to follow their dreams and aspirations, even in the face of societal expectations. <br>
                    The film's underlying message is clear: happiness and individuality should take precedence over conventional success. Through <a href="#rancho">Rancho's</a> character,<br>
                    the film brilliantly demonstrates the transformative power of following one's heart.
